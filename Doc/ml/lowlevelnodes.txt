= Low-level ML nodes =

Houdini has a family of low-level nodes that support the creation of a wide variety of ML setups.
These can be used to create entire new ML setups from scratch and also incorporate existing models, training scripts, and data sets into Houdini.

The most important of these low-level nodes are listed below:
