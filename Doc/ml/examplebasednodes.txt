= Example-based ML nodes =

The example-based ML nodes help to create an ML setup where a model is trained based on labeled examples.

Each labeled example is an input labeled with a desired output (target). 

There are two categories of example-based ML nodes: general-purpose ML nodes and domain-specific ML nodes.

The general-purpose ML nodes has a wide variety of cases and are not specific to one application domain. There are domain-specific ML nodes such as the [mldeformer] that apply specifically to animation use cases.
