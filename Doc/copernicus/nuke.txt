"""Differences between using Nuke and Copernicus."""

== Overview ==

This page is for users that are familiar with Nuke(tm) and want to accomplish similar tasks in Houdini using Copernicus.

NOTE:
    Copernicus images are always in 3D.

== Display images side by side in a 2048 by 1024 output ==

Use the Contact Sheet COP node if you want to display images beside each other in a 2048 x 1024 resolution output. This node is similar to Nuke's Contact Sheet node and an alternative to its Resize node.

NOTE:
    All images are centered at the origin in [image space|/copernicus/spaces] (-1 to 1) by default. When you use a 2048 x 1024 resolution output, the images also fit within that resolution. This means that your images overlap by default.

# Add a [Contact Sheet COP|Node:/cop/contactsheet] in your node network.
# Wire the images as separate inputs into the Contact Sheet COP node. The images are output side by side.
# (Optional) Configure the Contact Sheet COP node to change the images' stacking orientation.

== STMap node ==

Use the [UV Sample node|Node:/cop/sample] in Copernicus to perform a similar function as Nuke's STMap node.
