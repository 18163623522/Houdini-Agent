"""Describes what OpenFX is and how to use it in your network."""

== Overview ==

The Copernicus network supports the use of OpenFX plug-ins (shared libraries). With these plug-ins, OpenFX brings third party nodes into your network. Use OpenFX nodes when you want more functions than COP nodes provide. OpenFX also lets you use plug-ins that you already have in other applications in Houdini. Image generators are an example node type that OpenFX lets you access.

WARNING:
    Houdini uses a version of OpenColorIO (OCIO) that's more recent than the version in Boris FX's latest Sapphire plug-ins. This incompatibility produces a warning message from Sapphire. To avoid this warning, you can point your OCIO environment variable to an OCIO color file that's compatible with Sapphire.

OpenFX nodes are in [texture space|/copernicus/spaces].

TIP:
    If you don't want to load your system's OpenFX plug-ins, set the `HOUDINI_DISABLE_OPENFX_DEFAULT_PATH` [environment variable|/ref/env] to `1`. You also have to remove the `OFX_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable if it's set.

== Setting up the OpenFX environment variable ==

You must set up the OpenFX [environment variable|/ref/env] in your operating system if you want to use their plug-ins in your Copernicus network.

:platform:Windows
    # Choose __Start > Edit environment variables for your account__.
    # Click __New__.
    # Set __Variable name__ to `OFX_PLUGIN_PATH`.
    # Set __Variable value__ to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins`.
    # Click __OK__.
    # Log out and then log back into Houdini to use the OpenFX plug-ins.

:platform:Mac
    # Open your Terminal application.
    # Go to your `.zprofile`.
    # Enter the following command: `export OFX_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/OFX/Plugins`. This adds the environment variable.
    # Save your changes.
    # Log out and then log back into Houdini to use the OpenFX plug-ins.

:platform:Linux
    # Open your Linux Terminal.
    # Go to your `.profile`.
    # Enter the following command: `export OFX_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/OFX/Plugins`. This adds the environment variable.
    # Save your changes.
    # Log out and then log back into Houdini to use the OpenFX plug-ins.

== Using OpenFX in your scene ==

After you [set up a Copernicus network|/copernicus/index#access], press ((Tab)) and enter `OFX`. The list of available OpenFX nodes appears.

== Limitations ==

The following are Copernicus' limitations for OpenFX support:

* Neat Video plug-ins
* Nodes that require access to time (for example, retimers, trackers, and deflickers)
* Handles provided by OpenFX (for example, in a roto tool)
