"""Useful tips and information while using COPs."""

== Overview ==

This page includes additional tips and supplementary information to help you use Copernicus.

== Clear GPU and memory usage == (gpu_memory)

You can enter `copcache -c` in the [textport window|/ref/windows/textport] to clear your GPU and memory usage. This also recooks your scene if you have images displayed in your viewport. See [copcache|/commands/copcache] for more information about this HScript command.

== Move SOP into image space == (move_image_space)

When you import a SOP into COPs using [SOP Import|Node:/cop/sopimport], the geometry is placed in world space. To frame geometry into the canonical camera's view, you can use the [Rasterize Setup COP|Node:/cop/rasterizesetup]. Wire your input geometry into the COP's `source` input and adjust its settings to get the desired framing.

See [Spaces|/copernicus/spaces] for more information about spaces.

== View pixel position == (pixel_position)

You can view the pixel positions of a node in the [Composite|/ref/views/imgview] Viewer. Make sure the node's display flag is on, and then ((RMB)) and click __Inspect__ in the Viewer. Hover over the image to see the pixel details.

See [Inspect individual pixel values|/ref/views/imgview#inspect-individual-pixel-values] for more information about using this tool.
