### InputÂ

Automatic Input Size Detection

Allows for automatic detection of the number of rows and columns in the sample grid of the solver. (2nd input)

Sample Grid Size

Specified the number of rows and columns of the input sample image/grid (2nd input).

Pattern Search Size

Controls the “cookie cutter” size of the kernel that will be used to cut your sample image in. A lower value will result in less complex possibilities and therefore more noise. A higher value will increase the local similarity of the output image to the sample. This will also increase solve time and reduce the chance of a successful solve.

Find Wrapping Input Patterns

Enabling this will allow the pattern search step make patterns that wrap around the input sample image. It is not advised to do this if your sample image is not tileable.

### OutputÂ

Automatic Output Size Detection

Allows for automatic detection of the number of rows and columns in the output grid of the solver. (1st input)

Output Grid Size

Specified the number of rows and columns of the output image/grid (1st input).

Allow Rotations

Allow rotations will allow the patterns it found to solve the output with to rotate. That will help you get rid of repetition in your output image, but does result in a longer time to solve due to exponentially more possibilities.

Respect User Provided Constraints

Enabling this toggle will force the solver to fill the provided constraints using the WFC Intialize Grid sop. Turning this on will significantly reduce the chance of a successful solve, but proves to be extremely useful to generate more art-directable results.

Produce Tileable Output

Enabling this will force the solver to produce a tileable output image/grid. This is useful for tileable texture generation. It does increase solve time and reduce the chance to achieve a successful solve.

### WFC SettingsÂ

Seed changes the seed used for a solve, and therefore produce a different output using the same constraints. Great for generating variations.

Use Observed Sample Pattern Frequency

Observed Sample Pattern Frequency will tell the algorithm to take the frequency of patterns found in the sample pattern into account when deciding what pattern to place for each pixel. So if your sample image has more blue than red in it, the output image will also have more blue than red in it.

Number Of Solve Attempts

This parameter controls the number of retries the solver will make in case it fails to find a successful solution. Increase this value for difficult solves.

Starting Point

Enabling this toggle and specifying a number will force the solver to solve that specific point number in the output grid first. Sometimes useful when using user provided constraints, and you want the grid to be solved in a specific order rather than random.

CSV (comma separated values) is a common low level interchange format when no other format is available. It can be easily loaded as spreadsheet form into tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and most scripting languages have built in support for reading CSV files.

This ROP exports @P for selected geometry by default, or can export custom attributes if required. It also gives simple control over the formatting, but if more complex export formatting is required a python sop might be more appropriate; the script code in this HDA can be used as reference to build a custom CSV exporter.

### ParametersÂ

Render

Export a CSV file to the specified location.

Export Node

Houdini path of the geometry to be exported.

CSV Path

Location and name to save the CSV file.

Separate Vector Components

Export the vector components into separate columns of a spreadsheet when enabled. If disabled, vectors will be saved in curly braces, eg {1,2,3}.

Component Suffixes

Suffix to use for vector components, so if the suffix is x, and the vector is P, the column name will be Px.

Filtered Export

When enabled use the following multiparm to define which attributes to export, otherwise just export @P.

Attribute

Name of attribute to export.

## Labs Calculate Slopegeometry node

The slope of a surface can be calculated by comparing geometry normals to a vector. Eg, compare the normals of a sphere to a vector that points straight up along the Y-axis, ie a vector of {0,1,0}. Points at the top
of the sphere will be parallel to {0,1,0}, so get a value of 1. Points at the equator are perpendicular to the Y-axis, so get a value of 0. Any points with a normal below the equator will get negative values, going to -1 at the south pole, but for the slope those values are clamped to 0.

The slope of a surface can be calculated by comparing geometry normals to a vector. Eg, compare the normals of a sphere to a vector that points straight up along the Y-axis, ie a vector of {0,1,0}. Points at the top
of the sphere will be parallel to {0,1,0}, so get a value of 1. Points at the equator are perpendicular to the Y-axis, so get a value of 0. Any points with a normal below the equator will get negative values, going to -1 at the south pole, but for the slope those values are clamped to 0.

If this slope is stored as an attribute, it can be used as a mask for a variety of effects. For example, upwards facing regions to reveal dust or snow.

The base result can be further manipulated to fine tune the shape of the mask, the ramp parameter on this sop can be used to add or remove contrast, or invert the mask.

The blur controls can be used to soften the mask, at high blur values it can be used to approximate subsurface scattering effects in the mask.

### OutputÂ

Use Mesh Normal

Use @N when enabled, otherwise calculate normals to then calculate slope.

Up Vector

Vector used to compare slope. Normals that are parallel to this slope vector will get a value of 1, normals that are perpendicular or facing away from the vector will get a slope of 0.

Output Slope Mask as Color (Cd)

Output slope to color when enabled, otherwise write to the attribute specified by the next parameter.

Slope Attribute

Attribute name to store the calculated slope.

Ramp to adjust the calculated slope. For example, moving the first point to the top left, and second point to the bottom right will invert the slope values, or extra points can be inserted into the ramp to increase contrast or bias the results.

### SmoothingÂ

Method

Lets you choose different blurring models that have different effects on the point attributes.

Influence Type

## Labs Delightgeometry node

When textures are generated from photogrammetry, they will have lighting information from the source photos baked into them. This can make those textures difficult to use in other environments.

On this page | Using DelightParameters

Using Delight

Parameters

When textures are generated from photogrammetry, they will have lighting information from the source photos baked into them. This can make those textures difficult to use in other environments.

The Delight HDA can remove a lot of the light and shadow variation from textures, ideal for PBR materials in games and offline rendering.

### Using DelightÂ

- Ensure the photogrammetry textures are stored as @Cd of the mesh, an attribute from map sop is ideal for this. A subdivide sop might be required to ensure thereâs enough points to capture all the detail visible in the texture.
- Append a Delight SOP.
- Enable the 'Visualise Lighting' toggle, disable 'AO Brightening'.
- Turn 'Blurring Iterations' to 0.
- Set 'Number of Samples' to a number that captures the overall lighting information. This result can be blotchier than expected as it will be blurred in the next step.
- Turn 'Blurring iterations' up to blend the samples together into a smooth result.
- Disable 'Visualise lighting', see that most of the average lighting information has been removed, but crevices and ground contact are still too dark.
- Enable 'AO Brightening'.
- Set the AO sliders to their defaults (Strength 1, Blend Strength 0.75, Tint 0.75). Occluded areas will be masked and 'lifted', better blending them with unoccluded areas.
- Adjust the sliders to better blend the occluded regions with their neighbours.
- The delit textures can be converted back into images using the Gamedev Map Baker HDA.

Append a Delight SOP.

Enable the 'Visualise Lighting' toggle, disable 'AO Brightening'.

Turn 'Blurring Iterations' to 0.

Set 'Number of Samples' to a number that captures the overall lighting information. This result can be blotchier than expected as it will be blurred in the next step.

Turn 'Blurring iterations' up to blend the samples together into a smooth result.

Disable 'Visualise lighting', see that most of the average lighting information has been removed, but crevices and ground contact are still too dark.

Enable 'AO Brightening'.

Set the AO sliders to their defaults (Strength 1, Blend Strength 0.75, Tint 0.75). Occluded areas will be masked and 'lifted', better blending them with unoccluded areas.

Adjust the sliders to better blend the occluded regions with their neighbours.

The delit textures can be converted back into images using the Gamedev Map Baker HDA.

Delight works best with footage captured with diffused lighting, like an overcast day. 
    Sharp shadows from clear sunlight or small light sources can be minimized, but will probably require further touch up when baked into texture maps.

Photogrammetry models with large amounts of UV islands may get artifacts along the UV seams when using attribute from map.
    A Vertex Split Sop set to split on UV can minimize these seams.

### ParametersÂ

Number of Samples

Density of samples over surface. Higher sample numbers generate more accurate results, at a cost of computation time. 50 is a reasonable starting number.

Blurring Iterations

How much to blur the sample colours. At low values the sample regions will be visible as patches. At high values the samples will be overblurred, missing lighting detail. Ideally aim for enough blur to blend the sample patches together. Enabling 'visualize lighting' can help to see how much the patches are being blurred together.

AO Brightening

Toggle to enable the brightening of crevices and overhangs via inverted ambient occlusion.

AO Strength

How much to brighten occluded areas. Aim to make crevices blend in with unoccluded neighbouring areas. Values which are too low will appear shadowed, values which are too high will make crevices glow.

AO Blend Strength

An additional mixing control to blend the edges of the AO regions.

AO Tint

Amount to increase the brightness of the AO regions, adjust this until the dark crevices blend into their neighbours.

Visualize Lighting

Display the blurred and extracted lighting result only. Useful for debugging to determine if the amount of samples is appropriate, and if the sample blurring iterations is working as expected.

Lighting Exposure

Multiplier for the lighting visualizer if it is too overexposed or underexposed in the viewport.

### OverviewÂ

Rigid body simulation can require substantial cleanup before being ready for export. This HDA tackles the most frequent issues:

- removing small pieces
- fixing normals on sharp edges
- identifying and combining pieces that can be treated as a single unit
- clean up unnecessary dops specific attributes
- identify a region of interest, freeze pieces outside of that region

removing small pieces

fixing normals on sharp edges

identifying and combining pieces that can be treated as a single unit

clean up unnecessary dops specific attributes

identify a region of interest, freeze pieces outside of that region

### Using Destruction CleanupÂ

Taking the result of a RBD sim and connecting to this sop will immediately remove most attributes that arenât useful outside of a simulation.

When freeze transform is enabled and a threshold is set, this tool records where each piece is at the first frame and last frame of the simulation range, and if the total distance travelled is less than the freeze threshold, that piece has its animation removed. All frozen pieces are merged together, which can substantially lighten the final exported geometry.

If a bounding box is attached to the second input and 'Clamped Bounds' is enabled, RBD pieces outside this region will have their animation removed and be moved to the 'Clamp Position' location.

The node will attempt to optimize output by grouping pieces into chunks. This can take a long time for large frame sequences. To disable, toggle off the Optimize Pieces Into Chunks parm.

### InputsÂ

RBD Import (DOP or Cache)

The packed rigid body simulation pieces.

(Optional) Bounding Box

The bounding box used for optimization when 'clamped bounds' is active.

### BasicÂ

Simulation Range

The simulation range determines the frame range that will be used for the data analysis. It is recommended to leave these to the start and end frame of your simulation.

Visualize Chunks

This controls whether or not unique chunks should be color-coded.

### InsidesÂ

Remove Insides

This controls if surface points should be fused together. This will also trigger the removal of inside faces.

Fuse Distance

This controls the fusing threshold in units for surface points close to each other

### CuspingÂ

Cusp Polygons

This controls if polygon cusping should be applied to the newly generated geometry.

Select if cusping should be universal, or applied to inside and outside faces separately.

Inside Primitives

Group or face idâs to use for inside prims.

Inside Cusp Angle

When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.

Weighting Method

When set to By Vertex Angle, care is taken when computing normals to try to avoid issues introduced by sliver polygons and to weight contributions to normals by angle, so that triangulation wonât change normals significantly. When set to Each Vertex Equally, a faster, but less accurate, approach similar to the approach used by the Facet SOP, is used to compute normals, where each vertex is given equal weight around a point, and less checks are done for ensuring stability. When set to By Face Area, the behavior is similar to __Each Vertex Equally_, except that vertices on faces with more area will be given more weight when computing point normals. This is often used to fake the appearance of a smooth bevel for geometry with only a simple chamfer.

Outside Primitives

Group or face idâs to use for inside prims.

Outside Cusp Angle

When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.

Cusp Angle

When computing vertex normals, if normals of vertices around a single point are less than or equal to this angle (in degrees) apart from each other, they will be averaged together, weighted by the vertex angle in each polygon.

### Piece NamesÂ

Generate Name

This controls whether or not a new name attribute should be generated per unique optimized packed primitive

This controls the prefix applied to packed primitives coming out of the output.

### AdvancedÂ

Optimize Pieces Into Chunks (toggle)

Enable optimization of pieces into chunks.

Freeze Threshold (toggle)

Enable piece movement detection, freeze and merge those pieces if they travel less than the freeze threshold distance.

Freeze Threshold (distance)

This is the threshold in units used to determine freezing of chunks.

Clamped Bounds

This controls whether or not to apply bound optimization.

Clamp Position

This controls the where bound clamped chunks will be moved to.

Transfer Attributes

The name of the attribute(s) to copy. Multiple attributes may be specified. If no attribute name is provided, all of the source attributes will be copied.

============================================================

## Labs Detail Meshgeometry node

The Detail Mesh SOP allows you to project a so called detail mesh onto template geometry. The tool will analyze your template and will based on its UVs, project the detail mesh onto it to create the output.

The flowmap tools in Houdini work per-point, while the final result in a game engine will be run per pixel. This HDA allows you to render the results of the created flowmap using any renderer.

The only requirement is that the flowmap data has been converted to @Cd, which can be done with the 'Flowmap to Color' sop. This HDA provides extra controls for speed, distortion, and while it ships with a preview water texture, allows you to use your own water surface preview texture.

### ParametersÂ

Diffuse Texture

Texture to preview flowmap, default is to use a texture embedded in the HDA.

Diffuse Tiling

Number of times the texture repeats in the UVs of the input geometry.

Speed of the flowmap animation.

Distortion

Amount of warping applied to the flowmap preview. Larger values create a more pronounced effect, but can introduce ghosting artifacts.

Flowmap Mode

Set if this node reads motion vectors from @Cd of the input geometry, or from a file texture.

Flowmap Texture

Path to the flowmap texture.

The time at which the flowmap needs to distort at. This input should usually be fed scene time.

If baking a frame range, make sure to remember to add a $F to your filenames, otherwise it will overwrite the same textures every frame.

Start/End/Inc

Start and End Frame, and what steps to skip

Use MikkT Tangent Space

Use the MikkT calculations to bake out the Tangent Normal Maps.

The Viewport shader doesnât have MikkT capabilities, so you might see some bruising that wonât occur on a game engine. 
            You can use the GameDev PBR Shader in combination with the PolyFrame node if you would like to view the correct MikkT values. We understand this isnât optimal.

Output basecolor in Linear Space

Gamma correct the BaseColor maps

Tangent Normal Flip Y

### InstallationÂ

Some files are copied over to “C:\Users\Public\Pixologic\GoZApps\Houdini” the first time you drop a GoZ Export Node.

On the Zbrush Side, you can set it up by hitting the GoZ button if this is the first time you've ran GoZ and you will be prompted to find the Houdini path.

You can choose any of the provided houdiniXXX.exe but ensure itâs the right version number if you have multiple installed.

### Geometry DataÂ

The following attributes are passed across both ways

- Point Positions
- PolyPaint (CdPoint Attribute)
- Mask (maskPoint Attribute)
- PolyGroups (polygroupPrimitive Attribute)
- UVs (uvVertex Attribute)

============================================================

## Labs Make Loop2.1geometry node

This node will make either a mesh, volume or particle effect loop.

This node will make either a mesh, volume or particle effect loop.

The general idea is that it will offset the animation by half of the timeline and then do a sinewave to blend between the two animations.

This will work with meshes with constant topology or volumes, or with particles coming out of a POP net with the right attributes.

Mesh sequence before looping applied

Mesh sequence after looping applied

If you set the time range too short for particles, all particles will be removed before looping; You will therefore have to modify their lifespan settings accordingly. You need the following point attributes from an input particle system to get it to work: “id”, “age”, “life”, and “pscale” (it will be created for you if it is missing).

### ParametersÂ

Start Frame

First frame of the input animation.

End Frame

Last frame of the input animation.

Num of Double-Loops

The loops are always created in pairs of two, e.g.: if this parameter is set to 1/2/3, you will see 2/4/6 visually repeating cycles. This is due to how the looping effect is achieved. For instance, letâs say this parameter is set to N (and N is 2) and the animation duration is 200 frames:first, the base animation is divided into N sections (2 sections); only the first section is retained and it is repeated for N times (2 times);then, the repeated first sections (100 frames per section) are copied and shifted by half the section length (50 frames);finally, the base sections (repeating 100-frame sections) and the shifted sections (repeating 100-frame sections with a 50-frame offset) are blended or added together, creating seamless transitions. As a result, in the length of a single base section (100 frames), the visuals actually repeat twice (once every 50 frames). Hence the loops are more appropriately called “double-loops”.

first, the base animation is divided into N sections (2 sections); only the first section is retained and it is repeated for N times (2 times);

then, the repeated first sections (100 frames per section) are copied and shifted by half the section length (50 frames);

As a result, in the length of a single base section (100 frames), the visuals actually repeat twice (once every 50 frames). Hence the loops are more appropriately called “double-loops”.

Born Before Loop Start

Sets how to handle particles born too early. For the looping to work, the birth and death of a particle must be within the range of the first double-loop, e.g.: ifNum of Double-Loopsis set to 2, the end of the first double-loop is half-way between Start Frame and End Frame.

Dead After Loop End

Sets how to handle particles dying too late. For the looping to work, the birth and death of a particle must be within the range of the first double-loop, e.g.: ifNum of Double-Loopsis set to 2, the end of the first double-loop is half-way between Start Frame and End Frame.It is recommended to reduce the life expectancy of your particles to fit within the range of a double-loop. But if you have to clamp particle lives at the end of the double-loop, it may result in a sudden drop in particle count as a lot of particles die at once. You can counter this withFade Out Pscale.

But if you have to clamp particle lives at the end of the double-loop, it may result in a sudden drop in particle count as a lot of particles die at once. You can counter this withFade Out Pscale.

Prevent Loops from Repeating Particle IDs

Offsets the point IDs from different loops to avoid repeated ID values. It is recommended to leave this on. Please note that this will not fix already repeated IDs on the input geometry.

Particle Wrap Mode

Particles still alive at the end of the whole animation (from Start Frame to End Frame) will have the rest of their lifespans wrapped to the start of the animation.Stay Alive from End to Start: is best suited for Houdini; it keeps the IDs consistent and ages the particles naturally.Die at End and Respawn as New Particles at Start: is suited for Niagara; it offsets the ID, age, and life attributes to create two distinct groups of particles for the end and the start of the animation; it will often result in a few mismatched particles during emitter loop transitions, which can be countered withFade In Pscale.Spawn at Start, Hide, and Reappear near End: is suited for Niagara; instead of wrapping particles, it spawns them at the start, keeps them alive throughout the animation, sets their pscales to zero when they should be invisible, and then lets them reappear near the end of the animation; it does not create mismatched particles during emitter loop transitions, but it will waste some resources moving invisible particles.Never Spawn to Avoid Wrapping: preemptively removes the particles that need wrapping; it sidesteps the problem, but it will result in noticeable drops in particle count during emitter loop transitions.

Never Spawn to Avoid Wrapping: preemptively removes the particles that need wrapping; it sidesteps the problem, but it will result in noticeable drops in particle count during emitter loop transitions.

Fade In Pscale

Linearly scales the “pscale” attribute from 0% to 100% at the start of each particleâs original lifespan (unaffected by any modifications to the age and life attributes from particle wrapping). This is particularly helpful whenParticle Wrap Modeis set to “Die at End and Respawn â¦”, as this obfuscates the minor glitches that may happen during emitter loop transition.

Fade-In Duration

In seconds, the absolute duration of each particleâs pscale fade-in effect.

Fade Out Pscale

Linearly scales the “pscale” attribute from 100% to 0% towards end of each particleâs original lifespan (unaffected by any modifications to the age and life attributes from particle wrapping).

Fade-Out Duration

In seconds, the absolute duration of each particleâs pscale fade-out effect.

### VisualizationÂ

Output Preview Geometry

Outputs preview geometry with primitive spheres. The pscale attribute affects the scales of the spheres. Turning this on overrides the output of this node, so turn it off to output the actual particles.

Color by Normalized Age

Colors the preview spheres using the age attribute divided by the life attribute. The 0-to-1 value is mapped to the violet-to-red color gradient.

The MapsBaker can transfer texture and data maps from high resolution to low resolution geometry. Unlike the games baker which relies on a mantra render, the maps baker uses a COPS network that is orders of magnitude faster than the mantra equivalent.

Replaced byBake Geometry Textures COPandKarma Texture Baker LOP. To be removed in Houdini 23.0.

The MapsBaker can do almost everything the Mantra based baker can, with the exception of baking lighting and procedural shaders.

The baker can also be used to simply reproject textures from geometry on itself with different UVs.

### Using Maps BakerÂ

- Use a Labs QuickMaterial Sop to assign textures to a high resolution model.
- Use a Labs Soften Normal Sop on the lowpoly, with “Harden Seams” turned on to improve bake quality around UV seams.
- Connect the low resolution object to the first input, and the high resolution object to the second input.
- Turn on the checkboxes for the maps you would like to bake.
- Click the 'Render' button, and textures will be baked and written to disk.

Use a Labs Soften Normal Sop on the lowpoly, with “Harden Seams” turned on to improve bake quality around UV seams.

Connect the low resolution object to the first input, and the high resolution object to the second input.

Turn on the checkboxes for the maps you would like to bake.

Click the 'Render' button, and textures will be baked and written to disk.

### BakeÂ

Render

Execute the node to write maps to disk.

Manual Mode

Toggle if maps should be baked automatically on changes upstream, or if it should only bake when then 'Render' button is pressed.

Output Directory

Location to write maps to, use $(CHANNEL) in the path to ensure each map is written to a separate file.

Resolution

Resolution of baked maps in pixels. Use the dropdown for some commonly used values.

Tracing Mode

Set the method use to transfer information between the high and low res geometry. 'Nearest Surface' will trace the shortest ray between the surfaces, while 'Surface Normal' will trace along the normal of the low res geometry.

Max Trace Distance

When using Surface Normal mode, the maximum length to trace a ray. A small distance can optimize the bake process, and prevent issues where a ray traces to the wrong part of the high res geometry.

Visualize

This will visualize the cage or tracing distance specified when Tracing Mode is set to Surface Normal.

Preview Channel

Which map to display in the viewport.

### TransferÂ

Diffuse Map

Name for the diffuse map.

Normal Map

Name for the normal map.

Opacity Map

Name for the opacity map.

Roughness Map

Name for the roughness map.

Metallic Map

Name for the metallic map.

### GenerateÂ

Vertex Color

Name for the vertex color map.

Name for the AO map.

Thickness

Name for the Thickness map.

Curvature

Name for the Curvature map.

World Normal

Name for the world normal map.

Height

Name for the height map.

This allows you to specify the range that should be used for remapping the height to 0-1 when using a non HDR file format.

Name for the alpha map.

UV Fill

When this toggle is enabled, the alpha map will produce an alpha mask showing the UV shells, instead of showing what pixels of the map belong to valid traced geometry.

Position

Name for the position map.

### AttributesÂ

Custom Attributes

Define custom geometry attributes to be baked to maps.

Raster Depth

For EXR images with negative values, choose 16 Bit Floating Point or 32 Bit Floating Point. PNG images can be saved with 8 Bit Integer or 16 Bit Integer.

### AdvancedÂ

Opacity Maps Affect Tracing

If this checkbox is enabled, the baker will take opacity maps into account while tracing the highpoly. This allows you to for example bake card geometry with a stencil applied, and only get hits where alpha is above 0.

Max Translucent Layers

The maximum number of translucent layers the tracer can trace through whenOpacity Maps Affect Tracingis on.

Samples

This allows you to increase the number of samples made per pixel. This number will increase the render size in COPs, which might go over the max allowed resolution in COPs. To avoid this problem, increase the Resolution Limit under Edit>Preferences>Compositing/Cooking.

Filter

Specifies the filtering applied when multisampling.

### Normal MapÂ

Tangent Normal Flip Y

Invert the Y component of the normal map bake, required for certain game engines.

### Thickness MapÂ

Normalized Output Map

When this is enabled, the output map values will be scaled to utilize the full 0-1 range of the color space.

### AO MapÂ

Number of Rays

Rays sent out per pixel. More rays increase quality, but also increase processing time.

Maximum Ray Distance

Long rays can sometimes introduce over-occlusion, and cause long render times. Shorter rays will create cleaner looking occlusion, only darkening very occluded areas.

Intensity

Multiplier of the AO shading, higher values will produce darker occlusion.

Adjust the gamma of this map before saving to disk.

Cone Width

How wide will rays be fired from the sample point. 180 degrees will be a full hemisphere of samples, while 10 degrees will only generate occlusion in very tight corners or high occluded areas.

Ray Bias

Amount to move the start of a ray from its starting point. Sometimes rays can intersect from where they're fired; adjusting ray bias by small amounts can reduce self-intersection artifacts.

Material Mapping

This is the material mapping file used to translate from any material node to a format that the baker understands. Adding your own material definitions to this file would allow you to bake that type of material using the baker as well.

The Niagara ROP exports static or animated point caches to a custom json format that can be read by the Houdini Niagara plugin for Unreal. This could be used for driving particle emitters in Niagara, or creating complex simulations in Houdini that can be run in realtime through Niagara.

### RequirementsÂ

The Niagara ROP works with the latest version of the Houdini Niagara plugin for Unreal 4.25 and onwards.

To install the pluginplease refer to theHoudini Niagara GitHubpage.

You can find the latest information andlinks to sample fileson theHoudini Niagara Updatesforum thread.

### ROP SettingsÂ

Frame Range / Time Mode

Controls whether this render node outputs the current frame (Render any frame) or the image sequence specified in theStart/End/Incparameters (Render Frame Range).

Render Frame Range (strict)will render frames START to END when it is rendered, but will not allow frames outside this range to be rendered at all.Render Frame Rangewill allow outside frames to be rendered. This is used in conjunction with render dependencies. It also affects the behavior of the 'Override Frame Range' in the Render Control dialog.

Two possible cases where you'd want the strict behavior:

- A 60 frame walk cycle written out to a geo, but part of a larger ROP net to render out a larger frame range.
- A texture loop from 1-20.

A 60 frame walk cycle written out to a geo, but part of a larger ROP net to render out a larger frame range.

A texture loop from 1-20.

Otherwise, you will usually set this to non-strict.

Render Current Frame

Renders a single frame, based on the value in the playbar or the frame that is requested by a connected output render node.

Render Frame Range

Renders a sequence of frames. If an output render node is connected, this range is generally ignored in favor of frames requested by the output render node.

Render Frame Range (Strict)

Renders a sequence of frames. If an output render node is connected, this range restricts its requested frames to this frame range.

Single Frame With 'time' Attribute

Renders a single frame, with the time attribute set to 0 be default. Ideal for use with point clouds that represent impact points from rbd simulations.

Start/End/Inc

Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive.

These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

For example, if the parameters are set to:

Start | End | Inc
10.5 | 12 | 0.5 |

â¦there will be 4 frames rendered (10.5, 11, 11.5, and 12), so$NRENDERwill have a value of 4.$Nwill have the following values at each frame:

Frame | $N
10.5 | 1
11 | 2
11.5 | 3
12 | 4

Render with Take

The output driver will switch to this take before rendering and then restore the current take when rendering is done.

usechs("take")to use this value in other parameters. See thechsexpression function for more information.

Output Path

The output file should be of the type,.hbsjon,.hjsonor.hcsv(this format has been deprecated).

hbjson- is a binary JSON file format. Ideal for faster export and import, and smaller file sizes.

hjson- an ascii JSON file format. Ideal for debugging the results.

### AttributesÂ

Number of Renames

Rename any point attribute to match naming conventions in Unreal.

Overwrite Existing Attributes

If the specified destination attribute already exists, it is deleted and replaced by the source attribute.

Keep Attributes

A space separated list of the attributes that will be written out.

Cast Attributes

If necessary, you can cast an attribute to a type that matches the compatible types in Unreal.

Clamp Attributes That Are Outside Type Range

When an attribute is cast to a different type the value might be outside of the range of the target type. If this option is selected, the value will be clamped to the type range. If this option is not selected and an out of range value is encountered, an exception will be raised while writing out the file. Only applicable to binary format output (.hbjson)

### AdvancedÂ

Export Current Frame As time == 0

Overrides the time attribute to always equal 0. Disabling this will create an age attribute for the points that is relative to the current time in the playbar.

Export Start Frame As time == 0

Off by default. If the start frame of your frame range is not 1, but rather something like 1001, turn this on to use your start frame as time == 0.

Cast Attributes

If necessary, you can cast an attribute to a type that matches the compatible types in Unreal.

Clamp Attributes That Are Outside Type Range

When an attribute is cast to a different type the value might be outside of the range of the target type. If this option is selected, the value will be clamped to the type range. If this option is not selected and an out of range value is encountered, an exception will be raised while writing out the file. Only applicable to binary format output (.hbjson)

### AdvancedÂ

Export Current Frame As time == 0

Overrides the time attribute to always equal 0. Disabling this will create an age attribute for the points that is relative to the current time in the playbar.

Export Start Frame As time == 0

Off by default. If the start frame of your frame range is not 1, but rather something like 1001, turn this on to use your start frame as time == 0.

Falloff Iterations

Smooth the area of skin where the skin drapes away from the peak displacement. In contrast to Global Iterations this type of smoothing will not reduce the amount of displacement.

Normal Iterations

Smooth the point normals used for projection. Note that this will have no effect if displacement is computed purely from muscle centers (when Normal Projection Mixing is set to 0).

Step Size

This controls the size of each smoothing step for all types of smoothing iterations.

The pyro preview ROP is a wrapper for the mantra ROP with specific settings that are optimized for rendering volumes quickly for preview purposes. You can also create a light rig that mimics an environment light but renders a lot quicker.

### ParametersÂ

Add Light Rig

Create 6 distant lights for each axis with a master intensity controller.

Remove Light Rig

Delete all nodes in the light rig.

Render Control

Opens the render control dialog to allow adjustments of the render parameters before rendering.

Valid Frame Range

Controls whether this render node outputs the current frame (Render any frame) or the image sequence specified in theStart/End/Incparameters (Render Frame Range).

Render Frame Range (strict)will render frames START to END when it is rendered, but will not allow frames outside this range to be rendered at all.Render Frame Rangewill allow outside frames to be rendered. This is used in conjunction with render dependencies. It also affects the behavior of the 'Override Frame Range' in the Render Control dialog.

Two possible cases where you'd want the strict behavior:

- A 60 frame walk cycle written out to a geo, but part of a larger ROP net to render out a larger frame range.
- A texture loop from 1-20.

A 60 frame walk cycle written out to a geo, but part of a larger ROP net to render out a larger frame range.

A texture loop from 1-20.

Otherwise, you will usually set this to non-strict.

Render Current Frame

Renders a single frame, based on the value in the playbar or the frame that is requested by a connected output render node.

Render Frame Range

Renders a sequence of frames. If an output render node is connected, this range is generally ignored in favor of frames requested by the output render node.

Render Frame Range (Strict)

Renders a sequence of frames. If an output render node is connected, this range restricts its requested frames to this frame range.

Start/End/Inc

Specifies the range of frames to render (start frame, end frame, and increment). All values may be floating point values. The range is inclusive.

These parameters determine the values of the local variables for the output driver.

For example, if the parameters are set to:

Start | End | Inc
10.5 | 12 | 0.5 |

â¦there will be 4 frames rendered (10.5, 11, 11.5, and 12), so$NRENDERwill have a value of 4.$Nwill have the following values at each frame:

Frame | $N
10.5 | 1
11 | 2
11.5 | 3
12 | 4

Render With Take

The output driver will switch to this take before rendering and then restore the current take when rendering is done.

usechs("take")to use this value in other parameters. See thechsexpression function for more information.

Camera

The path the to camera object to use to render the scene, for example/obj/cam1.

Override camera resolution

Normally the image resolution is set on the camera object. Turn this on to enable controls that modify or override the cameraâs settings.

Resolution scale

WhenOverride camera resolutionis on, allows you to scale whatever resolution is set on the camera. To completely override the cameraâs resolution, choose “User specified resolution”.

Resolution override

WhenOverride camera resolutionis on andResolution scaleis “User specified resolution”, lets you set the resolution of the output image, overriding the settings on the camera.

Pixel Aspect Ratio

The pixel aspect ratio represents the width of a pixel divided by the height of a pixel. It is not the aspect ratio of the image (which is determined by the resolution of the image). This parameter does not affect rendering, it is only used to change how images are displayed, by stretching the pixels by this factor.

Output picture

The image or device where the resulting image will be rendered. You can set this value toipwhich renders the image in MPlay, or you can save it to an image. The following image types are supported:.pic,.tif,.sgi,.pic.gz,.rat,.jpg,.cin,.rta,.bmp,.tga,.rad,.exr, and.png.

Include$Fin the file name to insert the frame number. This is necessary when rendering animation. Seeexpressions in file namesfor more information.

Force Objects

Objects will be output regardless of the state of their display flag

Force Lights

Lights will be output regardless of the value of their dimmer channel

Env Light Intensity

Master intensity control for all lights in the light rig.

The RBD to FBX ROP takes in an RBD simulation containing packed primitives and uses its attribute to construct a flat hierarchy and exports it as an FBX.

### ParametersÂ

Render

Hitting this button will start the conversion process and write the FBX to disk.

### SettingsÂ

Node To Export

This should be set to the sop containing the RBD simulation you want to export. For example your dopimport sop.

Export Path

This is the path specifying where your FBX will be saved to.

Start/End/Inc

Allows you to set your desired export frame range.

With this parameter you can specify to only export packed primitives from a certain group.

### AdvancedÂ

Override Name

You can give the generated pieces inside the FBX a custom name. Useful if you have a certain naming convention to adhere to.

Name Override

Allows you to set the name override of the generated pieces.

Convert Axis System

Toggling this on will make the FBX get exported in a different coordinate system specified by the “Axis System” parameter.

Axis System

Controls the coordinate system that will be used to export the FBX.

Convert Units

Turning this on will convert the scene units used to the native centimeters used by FBX.

Export in ASCII Format

Enabling this will use the ASCII format to export the FBX. This makes it human readable instead of binary, but does increase the exported file size.

## Labs Remove Inside Facesgeometry node

This tool removes inside faces for objects that are intersecting. It does this without modifying any of the existing geometry like boolean does. (Except remove the occluded primitives) This tool only works on closed geometry.

This tool removes inside faces for objects that are intersecting. It does this without modifying any of the existing geometry like boolean does. (Except remove the occluded primitives) This tool only works on closed geometry.

### Inside FacesÂ

Remove Inside Faces

Enable / Disable the removal of inside faces.

Border Precision

This parameter controls the resolution of the internally generated VDB used for occlusion checks. Smaller values mean more precision, at a higher computation cost.

Border Threshold

This value allows you to offset where the tool considers the occluded primitives to start. Higher values mean that a primitive needs to be deeper inside the occluded part in order to be culled.

### Clipping SurfaceÂ

Clip Surface

When a second input is provided, this enabled/disabled clipping below that input surface.

Up Vector

This allows you to specify the up vector used to determine if a primitive is above or below the clipping surface input.

============================================================

## Labs Remove UV Distortion1.0geometry node

The Remove UV Distortion tool tries to reduce the UV distortion on geometry with pre-existing UVs. It does so by calculating the distortion found in the UVs and cut new seams based on that.
Depending on the polycount of your geometry, this can take some time due to the nature of the used operations.

The Remove UV Distortion tool tries to reduce the UV distortion on geometry with pre-existing UVs. It does so by calculating the distortion found in the UVs and cut new seams based on that.
Depending on the polycount of your geometry, this can take some time due to the nature of the used operations.

The tool is most useful for cases where you have clear “hotspots” of distortion.

Due to the algorithms used of flattening UVs, solving stretching will often result in self-intersecting UVs (overlaps). This is the reason the stretch toggle has been disabled by default.

Putting two remove distortion nodes after each other, the first with mode set to “Holes”, and the second set to “Peaks” often produces very clean results on heavily distorted UVs.

### ParametersÂ

The group of primitives containing UVs to be processed.

UV Attribute

The UV attribute to be processed. Useful if you need to do this operation on a non-default UV set.

Removal Mode

The types of distortion to be removed. Holes will search and cut nested loops in UV shells (which will occur when flattening a tube without connecting the two boundary edges), or peaks which are spots of distortion.

Iterations

The number of iterations to apply while removing distortion. The process of finding and removing distortion is an iterative process, so generally higher iterations mean better results. Higher values can also help cases where no improvements can be found while solving.

Use Distortion Averages

When this is toggled, the tool will insert seams from the “average location” of spots of distortion, instead of the point with highest distortion. Usually using averages produces better results, but this needs to be tested on a per-use-case basis.

Solve Stretching

Toggles if the tool should try and resolve stretching. (primitives using more texel density than neighboring primitives, indicated in blue) Note: Solving stretching frequently results in self-intersecting UV shells, and is generally left off.

Max Stretch

The maximum amount of (negative) distortion to solve towards. Note: Solving stretching frequently results in self-intersecting UV shells, and is generally left off.

Solve Squashing

Toggles if the tool should try and resolve squashing. (primitives using less texel density than neighboring primitives, indicated in red).

Max Squash

The maximum amount of (positive) distortion to solve towards.

Visualize Distortion

Toggles if the visualizer should refresh post distortion removal.

### AdvancedÂ

Regression Metric

The method used to calculate distortion amounts before comparing if an iteration has better UVs than the previous iteration. The default is Root Mean Square since it filters out any outliers we donât usually care about. (which averages does not)

Discard Regressions

Toggles if the check whether or not an iteration has improved should be disabled or not. Usually you would leave this on, but in very rare cases you might want to disable this to see what happens.

Flattening Method

The method used to flatten the UVs using the newly generated UV seams.

UV Layout

Toggles if the UVs should be rescaled and repositioned after solving. Disabling can save some processing if you do not care about layout or want to do a layout yourself later.

### Tips/HintsÂ

- check that your UVs are not flipped. you can do that by adding a UV quickshade and check whether UVâs are flipped, if they are, add a UV transform of scale -1 on x and make sure they are correct. If they are flipped the node will fail.
- everything really starts with your UV, Make sure its good (not 1000 small pieces), and make sure there is spacing between islands. A default UV layout is not good enough on more complicated things, increase the island spacing within the UV layout sop to get it working.
- sometimes the island spacing is just not enough, and you need to add a UV transform and scale the UVs. Be careful here, do small numbers, ad large values here take considerable time to calculate. something like 3 or 5 was sufficient in our tests.
- make sure, that based on your object scale, the minimum lot size parameter is actually achievable

## Labs Skinning Converter3.0geometry node

Skinning Converter is a SOP that can convert any non-changing topology deforming mesh sequence into a bone based animation. This is an important conversion if you need to bring a certain animation to a Game Engine. Game engines typically donât support vertex based animations, and require bones instead.https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/game-tools-skinning-converter/

This is an important conversion if you need to bring a certain animation to a Game Engine. Game engines typically donât support vertex based animations, and require bones instead.https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/game-tools-skinning-converter/

To export the result of the skinningconverter, just plug the three outputs into the corresponding inputs on theROP FBX Character Outputsop from KineFX.

To preview the result of the skinning decomposition, plug the three output connectors into aBonedeform.

### ParametersÂ

Static Primitives

This can be used to specify a group that should be separated from the animated geometry conversion. This will be added back to the result as static geometry.

Visualize Error

Toggling this on will visualize the skinning error as the vertex colors.

### Error VisualizationÂ

Converted Output

This links to the generated skinning conversion on OBJ level. (Set automatically by the tool after conversion)

Error Method

This allows you to control what method is used for the error visualization. Accumulated will calculate the sum of the error over all frames, while Max Error will show you the maximum error found.

Accumulate E Tolerance

This scalar controls how much error you deem reasonable in the visualization.

Max E Tolerance

This scalar controls how much error you deem reasonable in the visualization.

The bias allows you to offset the visualization error.

### Conversion SettingsÂ

Frame Range

Capturing Method

This menu allow you to pick the method used for calculating the skinning attributes. Biharmonic Capture typically has better results, but takes significantly longer to calculate.

Capture Frame

This sets the capture frame used to calculate the skinning weights on.

Max Bone Influences

This controls the maximum number of bone influences a vertex can have when using Proximity Capture.

### Bone Placement ControlÂ

Allows you to set the mode of generating bones. Uniform Placement does a basic scatter without taking the deformation into account. Adaptive Placement lets you place bones somewhat more intelligently.

Method

This controls the method used to determine where the bones should be placed.

Guide Scale

Sets the scale of the guides that are representing generated bones.

Number of Bones

This controls the number of desired bones that should get generated.

This controls the seed for the internal scatter that is used to place the bones uniformly.

Number of Bones Scalar

### FluidÂ

Particle Separation

The desired distance between nearby particles in the fluid.

Impulse Activation

Controls when particles spawn as a burst. A value of 0 means off, any other value means on.

Impulse Fluid Density

Scales how many particles get spawned when Impulse Activation is on. Particles spawned = Source sizeParticle SeparationDensity. A Density of 1 will use all available spawn points within the source.

Const. Activation

Will cause particles to spawn as long as this is on. A value of 0 means off, any other value means on.

Const. Fluid Density

Scales how many particles get spawned when Constant Activation is on. Particles spawned = Source sizeParticle SeparationDensity. A Density of 1 will use all available spawn points within the source.

Stiffness

Determines how closely Particle Separation will be matched.

Viscosity

Amount of velocity diffusion, creating a more coherent motion among nearby particles. This can also be considered the “thickness” of the fluid. Can become unstable at higher values.

Maximum Acceleration

The maximum acceleration that can be applied to the particles when applying Particle Separation and Tensile Strength. Lowering this parameter can help mitigate instabilities.

Tensile Radius

Tensile force causes particles to repel each other to prevent clustering. This parameter determines the distance (as a fraction of the particles kernel radius) at which this force is equal to Tensile Strength.

Tensile Strength

Magnitude of repulsive forces applied to nearby particles.

Vorticity Confinement

Counteracts energy dissipation by maintaining vortices.

Bounce

The elasticity of the fluid.

Bounce Forward

The tangential elasticity of the fluid. If two objects with bounce forward 1.0 collide, their tangential motion will be affected only by friction. If two objects of bounce forward 0.0 collide, their tangential motion will be matched.

Friction

The coefficient of friction of the fluid. A value of 0 means the fluid is frictionless.

Dynamic Friction Scale

An object sliding may have a lower friction coefficient than an object at rest. This is the scale factor that relates the two. It is a scale between 0 and 1.

Temperature

Temperature marks how warm or cool the fluid is. This is used in gas simulations for ignition points or for buoyancy computations.

Direction

Direction of Initial Velocity. Can be set here manually or with the vector handle.

Magnitude

A multiplier of the explosion force.

Variance

How much the force can vary.

Initial Velocity

The calculated velocity based on Direction multiplied by Magnitude, plus or minus variance.

Enable Gravity

When gravity is disabled, Initial Velocity will remain constant until collision.

Gravity

A constant acceleration in the given direction, the default being (0, -9.80665, 0).

Enable Explosion Force

Enables a radial force that pushes particles outward.

Spread

How much the force will radiate away from the explosion direction. If there is no explosion direction, a Spread value of 1 will cause the explosion will be equally radial.

Explosion Direction

The direction the explosion force will be directed towards. A value of (0, 0, 0) will be an equally radial force.

Source Wireframe

Display a wireframe representation of the source geometry.

### Ground PlaneÂ

Enable Ground Plane

The Ground Plane is a grid for the fluid to collide with.

Snap Ground Plane to Trajectory

Enabling this will cause the Ground Plane to be centered on the trajectory curve. Transforms of the Ground Plane will act as an offset from the snap location along the trajectory curve.

Distance

How far along the trajectory curve the Ground Plane will be snapped to. A value of 1 means the Ground Plane will snap to the tip of the arrow.

Orientation

Which axes the grid will be aligned with.

Vertical divisions on the grid.

Columns

Horizontal divisions on the grid.

Size of the grid.

Grid Guide

This is a wireframe representation of the ground plane.

### Collision ObjectÂ

Geometry can be connected to the 2nd input if a static object other than the ground plane is desired.
    Animated

Enable if your geometry has animations.

Display Geometry

Enable to display the static geometry.

### VisualizationÂ

Fluid Display Mode

How to display the fluid output. Displaying as Particles while adjusting parameters is recommended.
        Particles

Displays the fluid particles as they are in the POP simulation.

Surface VDB

Displays the fluid as a surface VDB.

Surface Polygons

Displays the fluid as full surface polygons (not polygon soup).

Voxel Scale

The voxel side length to use for the generated VDB volume. This is a scale on the Particle Separation length. For example, if Particle separation is 0.1 and Voxel size is 0.5, the side length of the voxels of the output field will be 0.05.

Influence Scale

The maximum distance at which particles interact. Small increases can give smoother results but increase the cooking time and memory usage greatly. This is a scale on the Particle Separation length. For example, if Particle Separation is 0.1 and Influence radius is 3, particles will interact if they are within 0.6 units of each other.

Droplet Scale

Must be smaller than Influence Scale.

Fluid Color

Color of fluid displayed in the viewport.

Dilate

Expands the surface of the fluid outward.

Smooth

Smooths the fluid surface using the selected method for the number of iterations.

Contracts the surface of the fluid inward.

Final Smooth

Smoothing performed after Erode and Dilate operations using the selected method for the number of iterations.

### GuidesÂ

Initial Velocity

Shows direction and magnitude of initial velocity without gravity.

Show Trajectory

Trajectory based on timeline.

Trajectory Curve

This shows the calculated trajectory based on the initial velocity and gravity force. Does not factor in explosion force.

Length

Timeline

Trajectory length is based on the local variables $RFSTART and $RFEND.

Known Issues

Parameters

### Loading a Substance FileÂ

Loading a Substance File is as easy as entering the path to your SBAR file into the File Path Parameter.

This plugin works with Substance Archive Files, not Substance Files. Archive files can be generated from Substance Designer asPublishing the Substance

Once a Substance has been loaded, parameters will be populated dynamically based on the graph.

### Viewing the OutputsÂ

The Substance Archive node will generate a new image plane per Output in Substance.

The easiest way to visualize this is by clicking the image plane dropdown in the Composite View Tab.

### Loading Inputs into the Substance FileÂ

Despite the COP node only having one input, we do support multiple substance inputs. Those come in as different image planes in the input node.

By Default they are name matched, so an input looking forroughnesswill look for an image plane of the same name in the input node.

Parameters for inputs are exposed and you can override which image plane you want to go into what input.

To have 2 File nodes come in properly into a Substance, you will need to use theRename COP

You might also need to gamma correct your inputs with the gamma node.

Below is the image of a sample network where 2 files are being read from disk, renamed, gamma'd and sent to the Substance Node.

### Working with Substance Files with Multiple GraphsÂ

In the case of multiple graphs inside of a single SBAR file, a new graph parameter will show up. Allowing you to choose which graph you'd like to work with.

### Hooking Substances into other parts of HoudiniÂ

To use the contents of a Substance Node in other parts of Houdini, you can make use of theOp Syntax

The{channel_name}syntax does not work with Mantra. To use channels with Mantra you will need to use theRename COPand rename your target channel to C and do theOp Syntaxto the rename node.

### Known IssuesÂ

- Animated Inputs Images are not supported
- Visible IfParameter Expressions for Outputs are not supported

Animated Inputs Images are not supported

Visible IfParameter Expressions for Outputs are not supported

### ParametersÂ

File Path

The path for your SBSAR file

Reload

Reloads the current SBSAR File

Size:
        Override the output size of the SBSAR

Substance Parameters

This area will populate dynamically based on the parameters in your Substance Graph.

Name Image Plane from Usage

Uses the Usage type as the name of the Image planes, instead of using the Labels. This is useful if you are hooking your substances into a material, and donât care about what the graph output was named, just what channel it should link to.

### SettingsÂ

Displacement

Specifies the displacement texture used during the projection. This is typically a greyscale texture.

An optional color map that matches the displacement map.

Texture Scale

The scale of the texture used for the projection. A lower value means less tiling (zoom in), while a higher value means more tiling.

Displacement Amount

A scalar on the displacement value read in the displacement texture specified.

Axis Blend

Controls the strength of the displacement on the seams of the projection. A higher value means more blending, and therefore less seams. Setting this value too high will make the seams too flat.

### AdvancedÂ

Axis Offset

Allows for offsetting the UV position sampled for the displacement texture.

Displace Y

Enables or Disables displacement on the Y axis.

Smooth Normals

Enabling this will calculate smooth normals, to be used as the direction of displacement.

## Labs Unreal Pivot Painter1.1geometry node

Pivot Painter is a sop that stores model pivot and rotation information in the modelâs vertex data and additional UV channels for PP1, and in textures for PP2. That information can then be used inside of Unrealâs shader system to create interactive effects.
This tool is specifically built to work with the material functions provided by Epic Games in Unreal Engine. It is however possible to use this encoded information in other engines such as Unity, since it uses common attributes and textures.https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Tools/PivotPainter/index.html

It is however possible to use this encoded information in other engines such as Unity, since it uses common attributes and textures.https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Tools/PivotPainter/index.html

Important pivot attributes are: N and name for PP1. N and hierarchy for PP2.

Important geometry attributes are: UV and name for PP1. UV and hierarchy for PP2.

Important optional attributes used for PP2 when using the “Selection Order” is theselectionIndexattribute. This integer attribute starts at 0.

It is now also possible to provide anupattribute on the pivot points, which will be used in the tangent calculations instead of trying to generate them. If you have an up vector already, it is highly recommended you provide it.

An important update made to this tool requires you to no longer scale up the input geometry and pivots 100Ã before the tool. The tool does this for you now.

### ParametersÂ

Export

Pressing this button will compute all data and export the required files to disk.

Allows for specifying what method should be used to encode pivot information for the given geometry and pivots. See the Epic Unreal Engine documentation for specifics and difference.

Asset Name

The name used for the asset that will be exported to disk. This name will be used for the FBX and optional textures.

Output Directory

The directory in which the generated assets will be exported.

Account for UE FBX Force Front X-Axis

Negates the rotation on meshes that have Force Front Axis enabled in Unreal.

Restore Input Scale

This toggle controls if the output of this sop should restore the geometry to Houdini units. This does NOT affect the exporting process of the node, and is only really useful if you want to do further processing on the geo before exporting.

Data Packing Method

This menu determines if the tool should encode PivotPainter information in the default way, or based on a custom configuration.

Layout Lightmap UVs

This forces the tool to automatically generate Lightmap UVs based on the primary UVs.

UV Padding

This controls the padding applied to the Lightmap UVs while they are laid out.

Custom range used for encoding extents channels with. Previously this was hardcoded to 2048 (like in 3dsmax) Lowering this number will give you far superior precision, and this change is coming to the max plugin soon too.

### Texture #Â

Controls the type of information that will be encoded in these channels. The value you choose highly depends on your shader in engine.

Vector Fields can be used to drive particles in Unreal. The ROP exports a compatible fga file that stores a velocity field.

The tool is built to export Houdini volumes, and will auto-convert VDB to native volumes. It is however recommended to do this yourself for maximum control.

### ParametersÂ

Output File

The path to the generated fga file.

Input Type

Volume

Use a volume with vel fields as the input.

Particles

Use a point cloud with the attribute v as the input.

Velocity Volumes

Set the field from the input volume to be used for export. Generally this is vel.*

Velocity Attribute

Set the attribute from the input point cloud to be used for export.

Override Resolution

If the input is a volume, the resulting resolution of the vector field can be changed. Remember, larger resolution require more memory and degrade performance at runtime.

Sampling Divs

Set the resolution of the resulting vector field when using a point cloud as the input.

Visualise

See the resulting vector field in the viewport.

Trail Count

Set the number of trails that should be generated for the visualization. This does not affect the exported resolution.

============================================================

## Labs VolumeTexture Export1.0geometry node

The Volume Texture Export is useful for converting volumes into textures that can be used in a realtime engine. Instead of creating a custom 3D texture, this outputs a 2D texture that can be read by all engines and then processed to be used as volumetric data at realtime.

The Volume Texture Export is useful for converting volumes into textures that can be used in a realtime engine. Instead of creating a custom 3D texture, this outputs a 2D texture that can be read by all engines and then processed to be used as volumetric data at realtime.

Use the dropdown presets to match UE4's expected volume texture inputs.

Internally the volume is converted to the target output resolution. That means one voxel equals one pixel and the resulting volume is a cube.

When exporting Density, make sure you are using a Fog VDB.

When exporting SDF, make sure you are using a Distance VDB.

When exporting Color, make sure you have a volume namedCd.

### ParametersÂ

Render

Generate the texture.

Valid Frame Range

Use the dropdown to render a single frame or a sequence.

Start/End/Inc

Start and End Frame as well as how many increments in between.

Select the mode which should be used for exporting the VolumeTexture.

Density

Density will simply export the density values from your volume into a texture. All RGB values will have the same value.

SDF will export your SDF as a texture, either raw or remapped to 0-1.

Color will export a volume namedCdto RGB, and optionally thedensityvolume to A.

Custom Vector Field

Custom Vector Field will take the specified vector field and convert it into a color field, which will export a volume namedCdto RGB, and optionally thedensityvolume to A.

Equalize Range

When turned on this will remap thedensityvalues to exactly 0-1 range.

Density in Alpha

When turned on this will export thedensityvolume in the A channel when mode is set to Color.

Invert Density

When turned on this will flip the values used for exporting density.

When mode is set to SDF this will enable remapping of values to 0-1. Use theSDF Rangeparameter to set the min and max values for the remap.

SDF Range

Set the range from which your SDF should be remapped to 0-1.

Custom Field Name

Name of the custom vector field to be converted into a color field namedCdfor export.

The WFC Initialize Grid tool is a convenient way of setting up a grid to be used as the sample or output grid for the WFC Solver node.
It sets up the required attributes in the correct way for the solver.

When using this tool to create an output grid or manually set up the values for a sample grid, the constraint multiparm should be used.
This allows you to select points and assign a custom value, which might be desired for making tweaks to an imported sample texture. For the output grid this is useful for setting constraints for the solver.

See:WFC Solver

### Grid ResolutionÂ

From Texture

When turned on, the grid resolution will be automatically calculated based on the specified texture resolution.

Texture

The texture to be used for initializing the WFC grid.

The number of rows in your grid.

Columns

The number of columns in your grid.

### OverridesÂ
